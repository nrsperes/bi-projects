## BI Projects

### Courses Intelligence
This project was developed after completing [Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-power-bi-up-running-with-power-bi-desktop/). I kept a spreadsheet to log the time spent on online courses (mainly Udemy) and decided to transform it into a Power BI report. The tables for the data model are also included in the folder and will be (probably) updated with new logs in the future.
